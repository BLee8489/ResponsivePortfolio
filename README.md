Homework 2 - CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

Application runs in browser.

Start with a index.html, portfolio.html, and then contact.html file. Adding style.css at the very end. Be sure to include an assets folder and upload your assets/images you will be using in there. 

Using Bootstrap I added a navbar, forms, containers, rows, and a footer. When clicking the items on my Navbar, they go to the correct pages. 
Included links of all  of my social media in my About Me.
