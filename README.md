Homework 2 - CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

The application runs in browser.

Using Bootstrap I created a nav bar, forms, containers, rows, and a footer. When clicking the items on my Navbar, they go to the correct pages.
I also included links of all of my social media in my About Me.

I started with an index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html, and a style.css file. I learned how to link all of them together, and make sure when I deploy it, everything connects and functions properly. I added all the styling at the very end. I learned how to include an assets folder and upload images to be used from directly in there. When doing my stylesheet, I customized the margins, color, and padding.
